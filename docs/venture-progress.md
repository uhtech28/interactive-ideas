## System Architecture

```
Ideas → Ventures → Checkpoints → Tasks → Evidence
  │         │           │          │        │
  │         │           │          │        └─ 9 Tool Types (Write/Table/Link/Upload/Map/Survey/Poll/OAuth/SelfReport)
  │         │           │          └─ T1/T2/T3 (Easy/Medium/Stretch)
  │         │           └─ 2/3 tasks to advance, all 3 = gold bonus
  │         └─ 8 stages, 36 total checkpoints
  └─ Wrap existing idea with progression

Bosses (1-2 per venture) → Corruption → Defeat → Monument
Levels (1-50) → Points → Requirements → Level Up
Badges (62) → Conditions → Award → Display
Flares → Help Requests → Responses → Resolution
Mentorship → Level 40+ → Mentees → Tracking
Cron Jobs → Daily Boss Corruption, Weekly Badge Eval, Daily Streak Update
```
